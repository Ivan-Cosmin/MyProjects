# ASL Translator & Recognizer

Welcome to the ASL Translator & Recognizer repository! This project is a result of our participation (team Signify) in the Hackathon InnovationLabs2024. It aims to bridge communication gaps by leveraging technology to interpret and translate American Sign Language (ASL).

## About the Project

This repository is divided into two main parts:

1. **ASL Translator**: An application that translates English text into ASL through generated videos, making it easier for hearing individuals to communicate with those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
   
   **Note**: You'll need WLASL dataset from Kaggle if you want to use this. Simply unzip the missing.txt, videos and the WLASL_v0.3 json into the directory **text-to-sing**. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/risangbaskoro/wlasl-processed)

3. **ASL Recognizer**: An application that can recognize ASL alphabet signs through a webcam.
